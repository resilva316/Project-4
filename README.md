# Project-4
Project 4 - CPSC 349 Web Front-End Engineering <br>
In this project you will design and implement a web application that communicates with
PocketBase, a configurable back-end application that provides authentication and data storage.
Introducing a back end and accessing its functionality from JavaScript will allow you to
implement features that were not possible with client-side JavaScript in previous projects.
